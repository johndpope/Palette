# Palette

PALette is an app for creating beautiful and unique color palettes from photos that inspire you. PALette provides an entry point for designers, illustrators, and artists of all kinds when beginning a new project by inspiring them, and providing a platform to easily record that inspiration in the form of a unique color palette to work from.

### About
Palette was created in February of 2016, as my final project for an iOS bootcamp at [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs)
It has since gone on to recieve +10,000 downloads on the App Store.
