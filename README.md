# Palette

Palette is an app for creating beautiful and unique color palettes from photos that inspire you. Palette provides an entry point for designers, illustrators, and artists of all kinds when beginning a new project by inspiring them, and providing a platform to easily record that inspiration in the form of a unique color palette to work from.

### About
Palette was created in February of 2016, as my final project for an iOS bootcamp at [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs)
It has since gone on to recieve +10,000 downloads on the App Store.

### v1.1.2

- 👀 Adds Peek and Pop behaviour to Palettes view. Quickly preview, share, and delete palettes from the main view.

- 📲 Fixes an issue where palettes were incorrectly cropped, or different sizes across devices when sharing.

### v1.1.0

- 🔍 By popular demand, we've added a ZOOM view to the color picker. Now you can get pixel level precision when choosing colors.

- 🎨 In fact, the color picker has been completely redesigned to be more intuitive and easier to use.

- 🌄 The inspiration page now automagically loads new results as you scroll, and now has way more results to choose from!

- ❌ Deleting a palette will now require confirmation, so no more disastrous slips of the finger.

- 😎 New users will get a pretty page to help them get started making palettes.

- 🏡 After creating a Palette, users will be brought back to the top of the Palettes page.

- 🔥 Added Alamofire for networking requests.

- 💻 Lots of code refactoring.
